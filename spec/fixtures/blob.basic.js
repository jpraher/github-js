But, you\nknow, it's so small that, if you think about it, what can it really do?\n\nThe idea here is to store a complete fledgling web application in a single\nfile like many small CGIs. But to organize it as a Model-View-Controller\napplication like Rails does. You can then easily move it to Rails once you've\ngot it going.\n\n== A Camping Skeleton\n\nA skeletal Camping blog could look like this:\n\n  require 'camping'\n  \n  Camping.goes :Blog\n\n  module Blog::Models\n    class Post \u003C Base; belongs_to :user; end\n    class Comment \u003C Base; belongs_to :user; end\n    class User \u003C Base; end\n  end\n\n  module Blog::Controllers\n    class Index\n      def get\n        @posts = Post.find :all\n        render :index\n      end\n    end\n  end\n\n  module Blog::Views\n    def layout\n      html do\n        head { title \"My Blog\" }\n        body do\n          h1 \"My Blog\"\n          self \u003C\u003C yield\n        end\n      end\n    end\n\n    def index\n      for post in @posts\n        h1 post.title\n      end\n    end\n  end\n  \n== Installation\n\nInterested yet?  Luckily it's quite easy to install Camping.  We'll be using\na tool called RubyGems, so if you don't have that installed yet, go grab it!\nOnce that's sorted out, open up a Terminal or Command Line and enter:\n\n* \u003Ctt\u003Egem install camping\u003C/tt\u003E\n\nOr for the bleeding edge:\n\n* \u003Ctt\u003Egem install camping --source http://gems.judofyr.net\u003C/tt\u003E\n\nCamping itself only depends on Rack[http://rack.rubyforge.org] and using the\ncommand above will only install Camping and Rack.  However, if you intend to\nuse the views you also need to install +markaby+, and if you're going to use\nthe database you need +activerecord+ as well:\n\n* \u003Ctt\u003Egem install markaby\u003C/tt\u003E\n* \u003Ctt\u003Egem install activerecord\u003C/tt\u003E\n\n== Learning\n\n* Start by reading the documentation in {the Camping module}[link:classes/Camping.html],\n  it should get you started pretty quick.\n* {The wiki}[http://wiki.github.com/why/camping] is the place for all tiny,\n  useful tricks that we've collected over the years.  Don't be afraid to\n  share your own discoveries; the more, the better!\n* Still wondering?  Subscribe to {the mailing list}[http://rubyforge.org/mailman/listinfo/camping-list],\n  the place where it's all happening!  Don't worry, though, the volume is just\n  as micro as Camping itself.  \n  \n== Authors\n\nCamping was originally started by {why the lucky stiff}[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_the_lucky_stiff],\nbut is now maintained by the _community_.  This simply means that if we like your\npatch, it will be applied.
